Note:
    How to work with GitHub:
        As changes are made, when a milestone has been reached that compiles with no errors, commit your changes and
        make a note. When a full change has been completed, "push" the files to the repo into the master branch and
        merge it with the project. It is possible to commit multiple times before a push.
